## Introduction

Welcome to the Advice Generator Application. I built this application using the React Frontend Library. I completed this project as part of my ongoing efforts to grow my skills in Frontend Development. The project required me to build a user interface and integrate the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com)

This project was completed as part of the Frontend Mentor challenge.

### Features of the project

The project has a single page. There is a button that users are asked to click on. Once the button is clicked, the user interface displays a piece of advice to the user.

### What I learned

In addition to building the user interface, I learned how to integrate an API into a project and have the user interface change based on the data returned from the API.
